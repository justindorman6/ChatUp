# ChatUp

The client-server model describes the communication between two computing entities over a network. Clients are the ones that request a resource or service and servers are the ones that provide that resource or service. We have designed and created ChatUp, a chat application which serves as a platform for users to communicate with one another. ChatUp implements a client-server model that makes use of TCP sockets.

For the application to function, the main server class (Server.java) must be run first. Following this, two or more client applications should be run (ChatUp.java). Default connection is localhost.

ChatUp consists of two applications â€“ the client application which runs on the users PC, and the server application which runs on any PC on the network.
The Server application consists two classes: Server and ClientController.
The Client application consists of a class Client and a GUI ChatUp.
